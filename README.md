# tiny-volumetric-display

- https://mitxela.com/projects/candle, very similar to this
- Deadbug led matrix like this: https://hackaday.com/tag/deadbug/. Would make it so LED's can be seen from both sides. Not sure what effect that would have



## Notes
- Can't use motor driver because it is too big. Use SOT-23 mosfet to control motor with power from battery
- use flyback diode to protect the board from voltage spikes from the motor
- No idea about how to show 3D image from software point of view
